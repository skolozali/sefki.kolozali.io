## Sefki Kolozali
I am a research associate in Applied Big Data Analysis at King’s College London. I am working on exploring links between the environment and human health through the analysis of very large time series data sets. My current research aims to reduce the frequency of hospital and GP visits by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). On this purpose, we use miniature mobile sensors to monitor patients' daily activities and their air pollution exposure. Moreover, we link the sensory data streams with patients’ daily records of symptoms relating to their condition (e.g. breathlessness, cough, wheeze and peak expiratory flow) and the measurements of their daily exhaled breath flow tests that are collected by using diary cards. I am also part of the W3C Spatial Data on the Web Working Group. Previously, I worked as a  research fellow in large-scale data analytics for the Internet of Things at the Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), University of Surrey, where I was work package leader in large scale data analysis and seamless integration of data sources in the CityPulse project. My research in the CityPulse project focused on providing solutions for real-time data stream analysis, discovery and integration, and quality analysis of large-scale IoT data to provide energy-efficient and process-efficient solutions. I have published several scientific articles in the area of Semantic Audio and Semantic Sensors, an interdisciplinary field in the confluence of Digital Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Agent Technologies, Ontologies, Linked-data, knowledge-based reasoning and the Semantic Web. These areas are some of the fundamental elements of the Internet of Things.  

I received the B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from the Near East University, Nicosia, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, in 2005 and the M.Sc. in Electronic Commerce Technology from University of Essex, Essex, UK, in 2008. I completed the PhD degree at the Centre for Digital Music (Queen Mary, University of London) under the supervision of Professor Mark Sandler. My thesis was focused on automatic ontology generation based on semantic audio analysis. The research aimed to investigate how the process of developing ontologies can be made less dependent on human supervision by exploring conceptual analysis techniques in a Semantic Web environment. The main application that I developed was a hybrid system to automatically build an ontology using timbre based instrument recognition techniques and Formal Concept Analysis. The potential benefits of such an automated knowledge management system involve a broad perspective spanning from knowledge engineering (knowledge acquisition, representation, and management) to cognitive robotics and  pervasive computing systems. I, therefore, practised an interdisciplinary approach involving diverse research themes: (i) audio perception, (ii) information retrieval, (iii) knowledge management and representation, and (iv) semantic web technologies.
